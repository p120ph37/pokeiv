# pokeiv
A web-based PokemonGO IV reader.

See INSTALL for some notes on how to use this.

Note: Niantic has begun banning some accounts that have used apps other
than PokemonGO itself to connect.  So far, this seems to just be
accounts which have done things that are obviously not possible with
the official app, but it is conceivable that they will also begin
checking for tiny differences in communication that might indicate the
use of even simple things like IV-readers.  So, until Niantic's position
on the matter is further clarified, it is probably not a good idea to
use tools like this on your main account anymore.
